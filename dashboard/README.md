# Responsive Dashboard Design

## Objective:
 Build a responsive dashboard interface that displays a list of user data fetched from a mock API. The dashboard should be visually appealing and adapt to both desktop and mobile views.

 ### Requirements:
 - Fetch a list of users from the API endpoint:https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users .
 - Display the user data in a card-based layout on desktop and a single-column list on mobile.
 - Include search functionality to filter users by name or username.
 - Implement sorting options (by name and by username).
 - Add ahover effect on each user card to reveal a "View Details" button.
 - Clicking "View Details" should open a modal showing additional details (e.g., address,
 phone, website).
